# optimal-portfolio

The efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk 
or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. Portfolios that lie below the efficient frontier are sub-optimal because they do not provide enough return for the level of risk. 
Portfolios that cluster to the right of the efficient frontier are sub-optimal because they have a higher level of risk for the defined rate of return.
In this notebook we use SPDR ETFs as example to perform efficient frontier and PCA analysis, and to find out optimal portfolios to produce best possible return at given risk.
